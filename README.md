# SLR: Compiler Design
SLR Project. Pls proffessor at least a 75 so I can be calmed during the exam

## Run

Use the run.sh file to run the program. It is incomplete. But it computes the follows and firsts, as well as the prime augmented grammar

`run.sh g1.txt`. In order to run the .sh file, you might need to add the exec permissions by doing `chmod +x run.sh`

## Dependency management
This project uses the [Jinja 2 template engine](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) to create HTML files. This package is NOT used in the computations
and it is only used for ouput formatting.

This program requires **Python 3.7 or above**. If you do not have it, [you can download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
The `run.sh` script already takes care of downloading the Jinja2 templating engine.
